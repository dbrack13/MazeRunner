# 🧩 Maze Generator and Solver (Java GUI)

A Java desktop application that generates a randomly structured maze based on the user's selected difficulty and allows you to visually solve it using either **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** or **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. The application includes real-time animation and performance timing for each algorithm.

## 🎯 Features

- 🧱 **Random Maze Generation** — Unique maze every time  
- 🎚️ **Difficulty Selector** — Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard  
- 🖥️ **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** — Visually displays the maze and solving process  
- 🔄 **Solving Algorithms** — Choose between BFS or DFS  
- ⏱️ **Timer Display** — Tracks and displays solving duration for each algorithm  
- 🎨 **Animated Pathfinding** — See the algorithms work step-by-step  

## 🛠️ Built With

- Java (JDK 8 or higher)  
- Java Swing (for GUI)  
- Object-oriented design
